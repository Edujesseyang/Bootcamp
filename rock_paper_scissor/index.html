            <h5>How to Play:</h5>

            <p>Start Game:</p> Enter 'y' to start the game. The game will start by displaying a prompt asking you to
            choose rock, paper, or scissors. You
            can type in your choice.

            Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors):
            <h4>Example Input: > rock</h4>
            <p>System's Turn:</p> After you make your choice, the system will randomly select its own choice of rock,
            paper, or
            scissors.

            <p>Determine Winner:</p> The winner is determined by the following rules:

            <h5>Rock crushes scissors.
                Scissors cut paper.
                Paper covers rock.
                If you and the system choose the same item, the game is a tie.</h5>

            <p>Display Results:</p> The system will then display the choices both you and it made, and announce the
            winner or
            declare a tie.

            Example Output:
            <h4> You win !! Lucky guy. this is your 4 times win..</h4>

            <p>Play Again:</p> You will have the option to play again. Simply type yes to restart the game or no to
            exit.

            <p>Rules:</p>

            Choose your weapon wisely and remember the winning rules.
            Rock, Paper, and Scissors are equal; no one weapon is stronger than the others except in a head-to-head
            battle.
            Have fun and try to predict your opponent's choice!
            <p>Exiting the Game:</p>

            To exit the game, you can close the game window or type exit at the prompt.

            <h3 class="subtitle">About my working experience:</h3>
            <article class="text">Yang's professional journey is a testament to a multifaceted career, marked by
                diversity, resilience, and a commitment to excellence across varied fields. Before embracing the call to
                serve in the Army as a 25B Information Technology Specialist, Yang managed an apartment complex, a role
                that demanded a unique blend of leadership, organizational skills, and an unwavering dedication to
                community welfare. This position not only honed Yang's ability to oversee operations and ensure tenant
                satisfaction but also underscored the importance of adaptability and problem-solving in real-world
                scenarios.

                Prior to stepping into the role of an apartment manager, Yang embarked on a career as an ark framer, a
                position that showcased not only physical strength and stamina but also a keen eye for detail and an
                appreciation for the craft of building. This experience in construction laid a solid foundation for
                Yang's later pursuits, instilling a deep understanding of the importance of precision, teamwork, and
                project management.

                Each of these roles‚Äîark framer, apartment manager, and Army IT specialist‚Äîhas contributed to Yang's rich
                tapestry of skills and experiences. Transitioning from the meticulous craftsmanship required in framing
                to the strategic oversight needed in apartment management, and finally to the technical expertise and
                discipline demanded by the military, Yang's career trajectory is a compelling narrative of growth,
                adaptation, and the continuous pursuit of excellence. This diverse background not only highlights Yang's
                versatility and capability to thrive in different environments but also reflects a steadfast commitment
                to serving both community and country with distinction.

            <h3 class="subtitle">About my education background:</h3>
            <article class="text">
                Yang's educational background is as diverse and compelling as his professional journey, illustrating a
                lifelong commitment to learning and personal development. With an Associate of Arts (AA) degree in
                Dental Assistance, Yang initially embarked on a path that emphasized precision, patience, and a keen
                focus on providing care and support to those in need. This foundation laid the groundwork for a
                deep-seated understanding of the intricacies of health and wellness, emphasizing the importance of
                detail and empathy.

                Simultaneously, Yang pursued and achieved another AA degree, this time in Jazz Drum Performance,
                showcasing a remarkable blend of creativity, rhythm, and a profound appreciation for the arts. This
                pursuit not only speaks to Yang's versatility and talent but also highlights an ability to synchronize,
                collaborate, and express emotion through the universal language of music. The discipline, dedication,
                and passion required to excel in jazz drumming are qualities that Yang carries into all areas of life.

                Currently, Yang is working toward a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Engineering, a field
                that marries analytical thinking with innovative problem-solving skills. This endeavor marks a
                significant pivot towards technology and engineering, indicating a keen interest in the digital world
                and its potential to influence the future. Through this rigorous program, Yang is not only expanding his
                technical acumen but also preparing to contribute significantly to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

                Yang's educational pursuits‚Äîfrom dental assistance to jazz drumming, and now computer
                engineering‚Äîreflect a unique combination of skills, interests, and aspirations. This eclectic academic
                portfolio demonstrates a passion for both the arts and sciences, underlining a life dedicated to
                exploration, continuous learning, and the pursuit of excellence in every endeavor.

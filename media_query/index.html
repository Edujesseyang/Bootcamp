                    The American Domestic Cat refers to the common house cat found in the United States, which does not belong to any specific breed but is rather a mix of various breeds and backgrounds. These cats are often characterized by their wide range of colors, patterns, and coat lengths, from short-haired to long-haired varieties. Domestic cats in America, as in other parts of the world, typically weigh between 6 to 12 pounds, although this can vary widely depending on diet, health, and genetics. The origins of the American Domestic Cat are as varied as their appearances. Many are descendants of European cats brought over by settlers for pest control, which then mixed with local populations. Over generations, these cats have adapted to a wide range of environments across the country, from rural areas to dense urban centers.

                    Tabby cats, including those with tiger-like stripes, are known for the distinctive "M"
                    shaped marking on their foreheads. The stripes can vary in width and intensity, and although they're
                    often referred to as "tiger" stripes, the proper term for this pattern in cats is "mackerel tabby."
                    The mackerel tabby pattern is characterized by narrow stripes that run parallel to the cat's spine,
                    resembling the fish skeleton, which is where its name comes from.
                    Tiger cats are not limited to a specific breed, so their size, build, and temperament can vary
                    widely. However, tabby cats in general are known for their outgoing and affectionate nature, making
                    them beloved pets. They are often highly social, intelligent, and playful, thriving in environments
                    where they can explore and engage with their human families.
